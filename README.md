A repo to try and achieve the brief set by Nology tutors


Pseudo Code

Brief:	To create a full functioning browser based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript.

1.	A working Game:The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.
Notes for this point:



2.	Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line. (We are upping the stakes... 25 commits)
Notes for this point:




3.Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM,  anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

Notes for this point:




4. Be aware: Collision detection is infamously difficult in JS so try to avoid this.
Notes for this point:














Game Idea
Knockout - Simple Dice Rolling Game

Landing page where players type in their names to go into the score sheet/playing area in the game page.
Screen is split into two playing sections so each player can have a turn at playing.
Have the numbers 2 -12 on both sides of the screen in a score sheet style. 
Have a dice on each side of the playing screen with players names at the top.
Extra - Players take initial roll to see who goes first.
Players take it in turns to get all the scores on the score sheet.
Each turn the players add the dice together and tick off the sum from the score sheet.
The first one to tick off all their numbers wins! (Look up confetti canon for the win)

Landing page where players type in their names to go into the score sheet/playing area in the game page.
Basic HTML and CSS
Rules of the game
Two inputs where users can choose their playing name
Possibly a place to choose a random avatar from an api?
Timer option? To stop at a certain time so game doesnâ€™t go on and on.
Button to enter the game





Screen is split into two playing sections so each player can have a turn at playing.
Basic HTML and CSS
Look at using a grid this part, easier to control
Grid border to get center line?



Have the numbers 2 -12 on both sides of the screen in a score sheet style.
